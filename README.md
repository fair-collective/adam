This is **not the full Adam**.  
This is a **safe, symbolic demo** of the **Fair Discovery philosophy applied to autonomous AI**.

**Full Adam is private, controlled, and under development.**  
This repo shows:
- The **vision** (in VISION.md)  
- The **ethics** (in ethics/)

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: This is a **thought experiment** ‚Äî not deployable. No APIs, no actions, no risks.
